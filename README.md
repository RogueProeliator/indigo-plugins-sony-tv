# Introduction
This Indigo plugin allows Indigo to act as a remote control for select network-connected Sony devices. All commands/buttons found on the standard, included remote can be sent to the device as well as a multitude of additional commands generally available only through network or advanced universal remotes. The protocol exposed by Sony devices, and utilized by this plugin, does not allow for state information about the device to be obtained (such as what current application/channel is active or what input the television is currently showing). If the protocol is changed or a device comes out that does provide feedback then it may be possible to enhance the plugin at that time.

Currently this plugin is loaded with the necessary remote commands to control Sony televisions; however, if anyone has alternate Sony devices supporting IP control (e.g. some recent Blu-Ray players) then it should be trivial to add support for those device types.
